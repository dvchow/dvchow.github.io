                                <h2>Why steel cables are twisted</h2>
                                <p>Steel cables are twisted to allow greater range of movement and flexibility. The reason this is necessary is because if the wires are simply aligned and bent, the outter side would be stretched and the inner would be compressed, placing stress on the wires. Twisting them together would distribute the stretching and compression across the wires.</p>
